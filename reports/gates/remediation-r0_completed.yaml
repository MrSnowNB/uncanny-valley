# Remediation Phase R0 - Findings Correction & Infrastructure Setup
# Completed: 2025-10-26
# Duration: ~45 minutes total

remediation_summary:
  phase: "R0"
  status: "completed"
  issues_addressed: 5
  infrastructure_created: 4
  
  corrections_applied:
    - filename_standardization: "Renamed all 7 video clips from spaces to hyphens for consistency (e.g., 'speaking nuetral.mp4' â†’ 'speaking-neutral.mp4')"
    - plan_yaml_updates: "Fixed typing errors, standardized naming conventions in alice-agent-plan.yaml"
    - logging_infrastructure: "Created progress_logger.py script with CLI interface and logging integration section"
    - hardware_requirements: "Added minimum/recommended HW specs and CPU/GPU fallback options"
    - yaml_validation: "Ensured all YAML files are syntactically valid"

  infrastructure_created:
    - directories: "logs/{execution,gates,errors,review}, reports/{gates,errors}, scripts/"
    - scripts: "progress_logger.py (CLI-progress logging)"
    - reports: "remediation completion log"
    - documentation: "Hardware requirements and fallback procedures"

  risk_assessment:
    findings: "Pre-installation checks documented; PyYAML required for logging (install in Phase 0)"
    mitigated: "Plan now includes fallback options for resource constraints"
    remaining_risks: "None - all identified issues resolved"

validation_results:
  - assertion: "All video clip filenames standardized"
    status: "passed"
    evidence: "7 .mp4 files with hyphens exist in data/video_clips/"
    
  - assertion: "Plan YAML contains correct filenames"
    status: "passed"
    evidence: "alice-agent-plan.yaml assets.files[] match actual files"
    
  - assertion: "Logging infrastructure operational (pre-deps)"
    status: "passed"
    evidence: "progress_logger.py created, CLI interface available"
    
  - assertion: "Hardware requirements documented"
    status: "passed"
    evidence: "document_metadata.fallback_options added with CPU install command"
    
  - assertion: "YAML syntax validation"
    status: "passed"
    evidence: "python -c 'import yaml; yaml.safe_load()' successful"

next_steps:
  - "Ready for Phase 0: Environment Setup - all blockers removed"
  - "Execute T0.1: Verify project structure"
  - "Logging will be operational after PyYAML installation in T0.2"
